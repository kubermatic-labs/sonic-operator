# Provisioning (ZTP + ONIE)

The provisioning server serves ZTP scripts and ONIE installer artifacts over HTTP so that new switches can install SONiC and receive their initial configuration. It can run as part of the controller manager or as a standalone binary.

When embedded in the manager, provisioning is not served while the manager runs with `--observe-only=true` (the default).

## Manager flags
- `--disable-static-config`: do not start the provisioning HTTP server (default `false`).
- `--http-server-address`: bind address for the provisioning server.
- `--ztp-config-file`: JSON file with ZTP parameters (default `/etc/ztp.json`).
- `--ztp-mode`: ZTP source: `templates` (default), `configmap`, or `generated`.
- `--bootstrap-control-kubeconfig-file`: optional control kubeconfig mounted into the operator and made available to opted-in generated containers.
- `--onie-installer-dir`: directory containing ONIE installer files (default `/var/lib/sonic-operator/onie`).

## ZTP
- `templates` renders the static scripts in `internal/ztp/templates` from the JSON ZTP configuration.
- `configmap` serves the selected ConfigMap key verbatim.
- `generated` renders one complete script from the matching `Switch` object.
- The ZTP script is served at `GET /ztp`.

## ConfigMap ZTP mode

Set `--ztp-mode=configmap` to select a full ZTP script from a ConfigMap. The provisioning server matches the source address of `GET /ztp` to `spec.ztp.sourceAddress` on a `Switch`, then returns the configured ConfigMap key verbatim. A missing switch, ConfigMap, or key is an error; no generated commands are appended and the leaf/spine templates are never used in this mode.

```yaml
apiVersion: sonic.networking.metal.ironcore.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Switch
metadata:
  name: leaf-01
spec:
  ztp:
    sourceAddress: "2001:db8:100::11"
    scriptRef:
      namespace: sonic-operator-system
      name: leaf-01-ztp
      key: ztp.sh
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: leaf-01-ztp
  namespace: sonic-operator-system
data:
  ztp.sh: |
    #!/bin/bash
    set -euo pipefail
    hostnamectl set-hostname leaf-01
```

## Generated ZTP mode

Set `--ztp-mode=generated` to render the entire ZTP script from the matching
`Switch` object. No ConfigMap script is read in this mode. The generated script
configures the hostname, saves SONiC configuration, writes any requested global
credential, and starts declared Docker containers.

```yaml
apiVersion: sonic.networking.metal.ironcore.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Switch
metadata:
  name: switch-1
spec:
  hostname: switch-1
  ztp:
    sourceAddress: "2001:db8:100::11"
  containers:
  - name: wirelet
    image: ghcr.io/ironcore-dev/wirelet:fixed-1
    securityContext:
      runAsUser: 65532
      runAsGroup: 65532
    args:
    - --name=switch-1
    - --interface=Ethernet0
    injectControlKubeconfig: true
```

Each container is pulled and started with host networking and Docker's
`unless-stopped` restart policy. `command` overrides the image entrypoint;
`args` are appended after `command` or the image entrypoint. `hostname`
defaults to the `Switch` object name when omitted. Containers are
best effort: a failure to prepare or start one is logged and does not prevent
other containers from being attempted.

### Volumes

Generated ZTP follows the Kubernetes Pod volume model: define named volumes in
`spec.volumes`, then refer to them from a container's `volumeMounts`. The
current generated Docker runtime supports `hostPath` volumes only:

```yaml
spec:
  volumes:
  - name: dbus
    hostPath:
      path: /var/run/dbus
      type: Directory
  containers:
  - name: sonic-agent
    image: ghcr.io/giluerre/sonic-agent:latest
    command: ["/switch-agent-server"]
    args: ["-port", "57400"]
    securityContext:
      runAsUser: 0
    volumeMounts:
    - name: dbus
      mountPath: /var/run/dbus
```

This renders a Docker mount before the image, for example
`-v /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus:rw`. The volume and mount names must match;
host paths and mount paths must be absolute.

### ONIE boot discovery

Generated ZTP can persistently configure the next SONiC reboot to enter ONIE
install discovery:

```yaml
spec:
  nextBootMode: InstallOS
```

The generated script creates an `onieboot.mount` unit for the `ONIE-BOOT`
partition and a `sonic-operator-onie-install.service` unit. The latter runs on
every SONiC boot and sets `next_entry=ONIE` plus `onie_mode=install`. It does
not reboot the switch immediately; the next reboot enters ONIE install mode.
`None` (or omitting `nextBootMode`) leaves the normal boot path unchanged.
This boot-lifecycle setup is rendered before hostname and bootstrap-container
steps, and remains strict: a failure to configure it stops the script.

### Global control kubeconfig

`injectControlKubeconfig: true` is an explicit opt-in to the operator's global
control kubeconfig. The default manager manifest mounts a Secret named
`control-kubeconfig` in the operator namespace at
`/etc/sonic-operator/control-kubeconfig/kubeconfig` and passes that path with
`--bootstrap-control-kubeconfig-file`.

Create the Secret before provisioning a switch that requests injection:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: control-kubeconfig
  namespace: sonic-operator-system
type: Opaque
stringData:
  kubeconfig: |
    # a deliberately restricted control-cluster kubeconfig
```

Containers use `securityContext.runAsUser` and `securityContext.runAsGroup`,
which map to Docker's `--user` option. The generated ZTP script writes a
private credential file per opted-in container, owned by that container's
configured user/group with mode `0600`, bind-mounts it read-only at
`/var/run/sonic-operator/control-kubeconfig`, and sets `KUBECONFIG` to that
path in the opted-in container. `injectControlKubeconfig: true` requires
`securityContext.runAsUser`.

This is a shared bootstrap credential. Use a restricted identity only; do not
mount an administrator kubeconfig. The current ZTP endpoint is HTTP, so this
mechanism is appropriate for controlled lab networks only until credential
delivery is protected by HTTPS and a short-lived bootstrap flow.

## ONIE
- Files are served from the installer directory at HTTP root (`/`).
- This supports ONIE discovery workflows for delivering SONiC or other OS installers.
